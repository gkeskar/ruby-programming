Challenge:
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.
You will receive the input via a function you declare. Any programming language can be used.
I'm making some automated infrastructure in the future... current judging is based on the honor system and output given by WC. Pipe your source into WC and post it into this thread with your best score.
Deadline is next Friday at 5PM Pacific time.
